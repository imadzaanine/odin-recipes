    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><p>8 ounces unsalted butter</p></li>
        <li><p>1 cup + 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</p></li>
        <li><p>1/2  cup + 2 tablespoons buckwheat flour</p></li>
        <li><p>1/2  cup + 3 tablespoons granulated sugar</p></li>
        <li><p>1/2 cup + 1 tablespoon dark brown sugar</p></li>
        <li><p>2 eggs, at room temperature</p></li>
        <li><p>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</p></li>
        <li><p>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</p></li>
        <li><p>1 teaspoon kosher salt</p></li>
        <li><p>3½ ounces dark chocolate, roughly chopped into chunks (about 3/4 cup)</p></li>
        <li><p>2½ ounces semisweet chocolate, roughly chopped into chunks (about 1/2 cup)</p></li>
        <li><p>1 (2.1-ounce) bar dark chocolate</p></li>
        <li><p>flaky sea salt</p></li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Preparation</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><p>In a small pot, bring the butter to a boil over medium-high heat. As the milk solids begin to settle to the bottom of the pot, the foam will burn off. Reduce the heat to low. Once the milk solids are a deep mahogany hue, another 4 to 5 minutes, and the air smells nutty and sweet, remove the pan from the heat. Carefully pour the liquid into a small bowl, scraping up all the browned milk solids on the bottom of the pot. Transfer to the refrigerator to resolidify, about 2 hours.</p></li>
        <li><p>Preheat the oven to 300 F. Spread the all-purpose and buckwheat flours in a large ovenproof skillet or on a sheet pan and toast for 10 to 15 minutes. Set aside to cool completely. (This can be done up to 2 weeks in advance and stored until ready to use.)</p></li>
        <li><p>When the brown butter feels softened but not greasy, add about 2/3 cup of it to a stand mixer fitted with the paddle (or a large bowl for using a handheld mixer). Cream the butter on medium-high speed until it is fluffy, smooth and white in color, about 2 minutes. Scrape the butter into a small bowl and set aside.</p></li>
        <li><p>Switch to the whisk attachment (or continue to use a handheld mixer). In the same bowl (no need to wash it), combine the granulated sugar, dark brown sugar and eggs and whip until the mixture is lightened in color and doubled in volume, 4 to 5 minutes. Swap the whisk out for the paddle, add the brown butter and vanilla, and mix on medium-low speed to combine, about 1 minute.</p></li>
        <li><p>In a medium bowl, whisk together the toasted flours, baking soda and kosher salt. Tip the dry ingredients into the mixer bowl and paddle on low speed until they are halfway combined, about 10 seconds. When the dough looks streaky, add both chopped chocolates and paddle to combine.</p></li>
        <li><p>Transfer the dough to an airtight container. Refrigerate for 24 hours before baking.</p></li>
        <li><p>Preheat the oven to 350 F. To bake in batches, top two or three half-sheet pans with parchment paper and lightly mist the paper with cooking spray.</p></li>
        <li><p>Scoop the chilled dough into plump tangerine-size balls; you should get about 15 cookies. Transfer the cookies to the pans, spacing them about 4 inches apart. Break the chocolate bar into 12- to 15-inch-long shards and press a couple of them onto the surface of each ball. Sprinkle generously with flaky sea salt.</p></li>
        <li><p>Bake until the cookies are golden and puffy in the center, 17 to 19 minutes. Remove from the oven and firmly rap the sheet pans on top of the counter to force the cookies to fall. Let the cookies cool completely on the sheet pans. Store the cookies wrapped at room temperature for 1 to 2 days or in the freezer for up to 3 weeks.</p></li>
